## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 🧱 **HTML5** — semantic and clean markup  
- 🎨 **SCSS** — structured styling with variables, mixins, and nesting  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** — optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens  
- ⚙️ **Gulp** — task runner used for building, compiling, and optimizing assets  
- 🧠 **Vanilla JavaScript** — for interactivity and dynamic behavior

## 🚀 Deployment

This project uses **Gulp** together with the [`gulp-gh-pages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-gh-pages) plugin to automate deployment to **GitHub Pages**.  
The contents of the `build/` directory are automatically pushed to the `gh-pages` branch, allowing the site to be hosted directly from GitHub.

This setup enables seamless and fast updates without manual publishing steps.  
It’s especially useful for projects with a build process or static site generation.
